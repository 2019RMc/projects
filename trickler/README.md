# Ammolytics Project: Open Trickler


## Software

The Mobile app for this project uses the [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/). The code can be found in the [`mobile/`](https://github.com/ammolytics/projects/blob/master/trickler/mobile/) directory.

The Controller reads from the scale and controls the trickler and was designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The code can be found in the [`peripheral/`](https://github.com/ammolytics/projects/blob/master/trickler/peripheral/) directory.
