# Ammolytics Project: Inexpensive Firearm Accelerometer

This project was first featured in an article which investigated the effects [Recoil has on Muzzle Velocity](https://blog.ammolytics.com/2018-12-12/experiment-recoil-vs-muzzle-velocity.html), and was [described in more detail](https://blog.ammolytics.com/2019-01-01/project-cheap-rifle-accelerometer.html) in a later article. I also gave an update on the [progress that's been made](https://blog.ammolytics.com/2019-02-23/rifle-accelerometer-update.html) since the first release.

## Software

The Arduino software for this project is in the [`sensor_logger.ino`](https://github.com/ammolytics/projects/blob/master/accelerometer/sensor_logger.ino) file. It's based on the [example code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LIS3DH) from Adafruit for the [LIS3DH sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BU70B64/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ammolytics0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01BU70B64&linkId=e9c352ddd0167d5c759dca3fdacf3b4f).

## Instructions

There are excellent guides available from both Adafruit and Sparkfun which explain how to wire the sensor correctly.

- [Sparkfun: LIS3DH Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lis3dh-hookup-guide/all)

And another for how to setup the RTC date/time and write to the SD card.

After assembling the hardware, you'll need to install the software in this repo onto the Feather board. For use at the range, I recommend disabling the `DEBUG` flag by commenting out the following line:

```
// Enable debug logger.
// Note: Comment out before running in real-world.
#define DEBUG
```

## Data Output

When the unit is powered up, it will create a new file based on the date/time in this format:

    YYYYMMDDHHmm.csv

While it's running, it stores a few seconds of acceleration data in memory before writing to disk. The write opertation can take around `10ms`, which is too slow to do constantly. It does write often enough that you should not lose much data at all when powering down.

Acceleration values are in [`G`s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force#Unit_and_measurement), which can easily be converted to metric or imperial units.

Here's an example of the resulting data set. 

| timestamp (s) | start (Âµs) | accel x (G) | accel y (G) | accel z (G) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1547749706 | 123593 | 0.750 | 1.194 | -0.191 |
| 1547749706 | 125917 | 0.801 | 1.191 | -0.222 |
| 1547749706 | 126979 | 0.853 | 1.112 | -0.212 |
| 1547749706 | 128040 | 0.852 | 1.092 | -0.263 |
| 1547749706 | 129097 | 0.944 | 1.054 | -0.223 |
| 1547749706 | 130158 | 0.973 | 1.021 | -0.201 |


## Configuration

There are a few variables which can be changed according to your needs.

- `ACCEL_RANGE`: Can be set to 2G, 4G, 8G, 16G (default: `8G`)  
  Greater acceleration ranges have lower sensitivity.  
- `ACCEL_PRECISION`: Defines the number of decimal places for the acceleration output (default: `3`)
- `SEP`: Defines the separator character for the output (default: `,`)
